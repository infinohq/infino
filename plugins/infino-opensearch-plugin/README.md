## What is Infino?

Infino is a scalable telemetry store designed for logs, metrics, and traces. Infino can function as a standalone observability solution or as the storage layer in your observability stack.

## Why Infino?
Telemetry data volumes are increasing exponentially yet there is no  purpose-built storage platform for telemetry. Most observability stacks are built on [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-rs), [Clickhouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) or [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), which are powerful tools but are not built for modern telemetry data so the stacks become complex and expensive to manage. Infino's goal is to reduce the **cost** and **complexity** of observability with smart, high-performance storage for customers and vendors alike.

## How it works
To address **cost**, Infino focuses on performance ([**see benchmarks here**](benches/README.md)):

- **Index:** Append-only inverted index (more performant on telemetry data than general-purpose indexes like Lucene).
- **Time:** Efficient sharding and storage based on data recency.
- **Tools:** Rust core using SIMD instruction sets and telemetry-optimized compression.

To address **complexity**, Infino focuses on AI and automation:

- **Access:** NLP support + charts-on-demand for chat interfaces like Slack or Teams.
- **Management:** No schema, no labels, no master node + autoscaled everything.
- **Analysis:** Hypeless LLMs + scalable search to accelerate your investigations.


# What is the Infino plugin for OpenSearch?

An Infino Collection is a set of automanaged indexes in OpenSearch.  A collection consists internally of optimized indexes for both documents (Lucene) and telemetry (Infino) that are searchable together. Collections also have built-in AI co-pilots to do summarizations and root cause analysis.

Infino Collections are a great option for security and observability use cases, particularly if users do not want to manage and scale OpenSearch themselves. Infino Collections enable a much faster/cheaper/simpler version of OpenSearch for security and observability that accelerate root-cause analysis by combining code, tickets, telemetry, etc. 

In OpenSearch, a collection is represented by an index named Infino which contains stats about the collection and otherwise generally behaves as a normal index in OpenSearch. The caveat is that since collections are autoscaled and automanaged, the number of shards and replicas etc. for an Infino collection will always show as 1 and several index operations like split, merge, replicate, etc. are not honored as they donâ€™t make sense for collections. 

Cluster requests work as normal but do not impact Infino Collections which are automanaged.

## Developer Docs
Read the OpenSearch documentation [here](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/search/). We do not support all API calls; we will be building a documented list of what we support. More to come.

## Features
Note that we are still very much an alpha product but we have lots on the roadmap. Our development at the moment is focused on increasing the performance of the core engine to address **cost** but we are starting to add features to address **complexity**. We hope to transform OpenSearch into a best-in-class observability stack.

#### Available now
 - We are currently focused on improving logs / metrics performance in OpenSearch by 10x.

#### Coming soon
- NLP
- Traces
- LLM monitoring using [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
- AI copilot

## Getting started

### Try it
For now, you need to build the repo. You will first need to:

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- Install [SDKMan](hhttps://sdkman.io/).
- Clone [Infino](https://github.com/infinohq/infino).
- Clone [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch).
- Clone [OpenSearch dashboard](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards).
- Gradle build


### Instructions
#### Set [SDKMan to use Java 17](https://sdkman.io/usage)
#### Add the following to your Java policy
`$HOME/.sdkman/candidates/java/current/conf/security/java.policy`
```
grant {
  // Add permissions to allow Infino OpenSearch Plugin to access Infino using OpenSearch threadpool
permission org.opensearch.secure_sm.ThreadPermission "modifyArbitraryThread";
permission java.net.URLPermission "http://localhost:3000/-", "*";
}
```
#### Build the plugin
1. Go the infino-search-plugin root directory
2. Type ``./gradlew build``
#### Install the plugin in OpenSearch and launch
1. Go to the OpenSearch root directory
2. Remove any old infino plugins `bin/opensearch-plugin remove infino-opensearch-plugin-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
2. Install the plugin bin/opensearch-plugin -v install `file:///path/to/infino-opensearch-plugin/build/distributions/infino-opensearch-plugin-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip` (note that you should replace 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT with your opensearch version number)
3. Run OpenSearch `bin/opensearch` - this will start OpenSearch on port 9200.

#### Build Infino and launch
1. Go to the Infino root dir.
2. Type `make run` - this will start Infino on port 3000.

#### Test the chain is working
1. In any shell window, type `curl http://localhost:9200/infino/my-index/_ping`. You should receive a response 'OK'.
#### Start OpenSearch Dashboard
1. Go to the OpenSearch Dashboard root dir
2. Type `npm install 18`
3. Type `yarn osd clean`
4. Type `yarn osd bootstrap`
5. Type `yarn start`
6. From stdout you will see a line like this: `server log   [03:45:12.165] [info][server][OpenSearchDashboards][http] http server running at http://localhost:5603/qtf`. Point your brower to the URL.


Please file an issue if you face any problems or contact us directly if you want to discuss your use-case over virtual coffee.

## How to access your Infino collection
All indexes in Infino have a mirror Lucene index prefixed with `infino-`. Accessing infino-my-index, for example, will give you stats about your Infino Collection. However, to act on your Infino collection (post a doc or search etc) you will access the collection as `/infino/my-index`.
