    Infino Dashboard - Example of Generating Dashboard from Code
</p>

If you haven't explored Infino yet, please refer to:
 - [Infino git repo](https://github.com/infinohq/infino)

## Quick Start
Infino dashboards can be generated in code using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). 

### Example Logs Dashboard
You can find an example dashboard code [here](src/example_logs_dashboard.py). To get started quickly and experience how it looks like, see the driver script that 
starts/stops Infino and populates data to be displayed [here](src/driver.py).

To run the driver script - run `make run-driver`

To run only the logs dashboard (after starting Infino and populating data) - run `make logs-dashboard`

### Example Metrics Dashboard

Coming Soon

## How does it look?
